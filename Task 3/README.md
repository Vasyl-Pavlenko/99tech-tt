# Issues and Anti-Patterns in the Original Code:
## Inefficient Priority Calculation:

The getPriority function, which determines the priority of a blockchain, is defined inside the component, causing it to be recreated on every render. This function should be moved outside the component to avoid unnecessary re-creation and improve performance.

## Complex and Redundant Logic in Filtering and Sorting:

The filtering logic inside useMemo is overly complex and redundant. The code checks the priority and amount in a nested manner, which complicates understanding and might lead to logical errors. It also contains redundant conditions that don't contribute to the actual filtering process.
Sorting and filtering are mixed together, which could be separated for clarity and better performance.

## Unnecessary Recalculations:

The prices dependency in the useMemo hook is unnecessary for the sortedBalances calculation, as prices do not affect the filtering or sorting of balances. Including it leads to unnecessary recalculations whenever prices change.

## Key Generation Using Index:

Using an array index (index) as the key in the rows mapping could lead to rendering issues if the order of items changes, which React uses to identify list items. A unique and stable key based on the currency and blockchain values should be used instead.

## Unnecessary formattedBalances Mapping:

The formattedBalances array is created but not used in the final rows mapping, resulting in an extra iteration over the balances that does not contribute to the final output.

# Refactored Code Improvements:
## Moving getPriority Outside the Component:

The getPriority function is moved outside the component to prevent it from being recreated on every render.

## Simplified and Efficient Filtering and Sorting:

The filtering and sorting logic is simplified and separated, making it easier to read and more efficient. Redundant conditions are removed, and the logic is streamlined to only check necessary conditions.

## Correct Dependency Array in useMemo:

The useMemo hook for sortedBalances is now correctly dependent only on balances, as prices are not required for sorting or filtering.

## Stable Key Generation:

The key for each row is generated using a combination of currency and blockchain, ensuring stability even if the order of balances changes.

## Direct Use of sortedBalances:

The sortedBalances array is directly mapped to the rows, removing the unnecessary creation of formattedBalances.
